An image is a representation of the requirements for that 
particular container to run.

| Docker run-time (daemon) is used to do the following: 
| ----------------

| ----------------

A Docker file is a plain text file that contains instructions that 
tell the Docker Build Engine how to create an image

example of a docker file 

FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN echo 'hello' > /message

CMD ["cat", "/message"]
CMD ["cat", "/message2"]

to build the image from the above docker file contents
